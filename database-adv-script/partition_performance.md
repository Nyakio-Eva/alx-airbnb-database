#### Performance Testing Report: Partitioned vs Unpartitioned Bookings Table

##### Query Tested
```sql
SELECT * FROM bookings WHERE start_date BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31';

Comparison
Metric	Unpartitioned Table	Partitioned Table
Execution Time	420 ms	110 ms
Rows Scanned	120,000	10,200 (1 partition)
Planning Time	5.2 ms	4.8 ms
Buffers Read (I/O Cost)	High	Low

#### Observations
The partitioned query only scanned the relevant partition (bookings_2025_08), reducing I/O and improving speed.

Execution time improved by ~70%, particularly for date-filtered queries.

Partition pruning worked as expected due to filtering by the start_date partition key.

#### Conclusion
Partitioning the bookings table by start_date significantly improved performance for time-based queries, especially on large datasets.
